fristly we have to launch an instance by script
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install httpd -y
echo "<html><body><center><h1>Hello Techie! Have a Nice Day.</h1></center></body></html>">/var/www/html/index.html
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
after that when instance get launch host a public ip in your google tab page will be host
now go to mobaxtream ssh get into by access key and configure aws 
curl localhost 
your page will be host on mobaxtream.
